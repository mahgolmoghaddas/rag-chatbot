Product Overview

The Internal Knowledge Assistant allows users to ask natural language questions
about company documentation and receive context-aware answers.

The system is designed to prevent hallucinations by answering only from
verified internal sources.

If relevant information cannot be found with sufficient confidence,
the assistant defers to human customer support.
