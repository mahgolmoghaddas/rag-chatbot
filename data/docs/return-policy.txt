Refund Policy

We offer a 14-day refund window for all standard subscription plans.
Customers may request a refund within 14 days of the initial purchase date,
provided that the service has not been abused or used in violation of our terms.

Refunds are not available for:
- Enterprise contracts
- Custom integrations
- Services that have already been fully delivered

Refund requests must be submitted through customer support and may take
5–10 business days to process once approved.

If a subscription is canceled after the refund window, access will remain
active until the end of the current billing cycle.
